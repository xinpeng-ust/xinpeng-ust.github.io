### Biography

{: .text-justify}
*Jingwen Tong* received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2015, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Ningbo University, Ningbo, China, in 2018, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Informatics and Communication System, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China. From 2019 to 2020, he was a Visiting Ph.D. Student with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, USA. Currently, he is a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). His main research interests include multi-armed bandit (MAB), optimization, Foundation model, and resource allocation in wireless communications. Here is the [CV](https://github.com/jwentong/jwentong.github.io/tree/master/assets/documents/Jingwen-Tong.pdf).
